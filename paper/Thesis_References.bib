abstract = {Contamination of groundwater by leaking CO2 is a potential risk of carbon sequestration. With the help of a field experiment in western Denmark, we investigate to what extent surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can detect and image dissolved CO2 in a shallow aquifer. For this purpose, we injected CO2 at a depth of 5 and 10m and monitored its migration using 320 electrodes on a 126m√ó25m surface grid. A fully automated acquisition system continuously collected data and uploaded it into an online database. The large amount of data allows for time-series analysis using geostatistical techniques for noise estimation and data interpolation to compensate for intermittent instrument failure. We estimate a time-dependent noise level for each ERT configuration, taking data variation and measurement frequency into account.A baseline inversion reveals the geology at the site consisting of aeolian and glacial sands near the surface and marine sands below 10m depth. 3-D time-lapse ERT inversions clearly image the dissolved CO2 plume with decreased electrical resistivity values. We can image the geochemical changes induced by the dissolved CO2 until the end of the acquisition, 120days after the injection start. During these 120days, the CO2 migrates about 25m in the expected groundwater flow direction. Water electrical conductivity (EC) sampling using small screens in 29 wells allows for very good verification of the ERT results. Water EC and ERT results generally agree very well, with the water sampling showing some fine-scale variations that cannot be resolved by the ERT. The ERT images have their strength in outlining the plume's shape in three dimensions and in being able to image the plume outside the well field. These results highlight the potential for imaging dissolved CO2 using non-intrusive surface electrical resistivity tomography. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Electrical and electromagnetic ?E&EM? methods for near- surface investigations have undergone rapid improvements over the past few decades. Besides the traditional applica- tions in groundwater investigations, natural-resource explo- ration, and geological mapping, a number of new applica- tions have appeared. These include hazardous-waste charac- terization studies, precision-agriculture applications, archeo- logical surveys, and geotechnical investigations. The inclu- sion of microprocessors in survey instruments, development ofnewinterpretation algorithms, and easy access to powerful computers have supported innovation throughout the geo- physical community and theE&EMcommunity is no excep- tion. Most notable are development of continuous-measure- ment systems that generate large, dense data sets efficiently. These have contributed significantly to the usefulness of E&EM methods by allowing measurements over wide areas without sacrificing lateral resolution. The availability of these luxuriant data sets in turn spurred development of inter- pretation algorithms, including: Laterally constrained 1D in- version as well as innovative 2D- and 3D-inversion methods. Taken together, these developments can be expected to im- prove the resolution and usefulness of E&EM methods and permit them to be applied economically. The trend is clearly toward dense surveying over larger areas, followed by highly automated, post-acquisition processing and interpretation to provide improved resolution of the shallow subsurface in a cost-effective manner.

In some cases, it is the trace of the matrix rather than the diagonal that is needed. This paper describes methods for estimating diagonals and traces of matrices in these situations. The goal is to obtain a good estimate of the diagonal by applying only a small number of matrix-vector products, using selected vectors. We begin by considering the use of random test vectors and then explore special vectors obtained from Hadamard matrices. The methods are tested in the context of computational materials science to estimate the diagonal of the density matrix which holds the charge densities. Numerical experiments indicate that the diagonal estimator may offer an alternative method that in some cases can greatly reduce computational costs in electronic structures calculations. {\textcopyright} 2007 IMACS.},

abstract = {Solution/collapse structures pose a serious economic threat to potash'mines in Saskatchewan due to flooding. This study encompasses the first phase of a joint Queen's University - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS) research project, and. investigates the delineation of solution/collapse structures using in-seam seismic techniques. Three seismic survey experiments were performed at the PCS Rocanville mine where a collapse structure is located within a 1800 m X 1830 m mining panel. Two of these experiments were designed to collect data suitable for tomographic imaging. In the first survey approximately 9000 waveforms were measured on hydrophones at 96 source/receiver locations about the panel. Data required comprehensive signal processing to improve signal to noise ratios and permit estimation of P- and S-wave traveltimes for tomographic inversion. Three component data were measured in the second survey at 48 source/receiver locations and processed using polarization analysis techniques to estimate traveltimes more accurately and permit a preliminary analysis of attenuation. Traveltime data from both surveys were processed using algebraic reconstruction (ART) and matrix inversion (SVD) techniques to yield velocity images. The final experiment investigated the possibility of a back-scattering response from the structure using a standard CDP reflection survey setup within the plane of the panel. The effects of head waves on tomographic imaging observed in a pilot study were eliminated through the application of a band-pass filter. Results indicate that the extent and magnitude of an anomalous seismic response characterizing the structure are less pronounced than originally predicted. Velocity contrasts are too low to provide reliable results from the ART algorithm. SVD images of P-wave velocity reveal a restricted low-velocity zone appropriately located and probably attributable to the collapse structure. Stacked CDP sections from the third survey failed to record any reflections from the structure indicating that the acoustic impedance contrast between the disturbed zone and the unaffected rock mass is likely gradational rather than abrupt. The" lack of a more definitive response dictates that future work focus on determining more precisely the diagnostic physical properties of the collapse zone. Data from more detailed seismic studies interpreted in conjunction with those from other geophysical methods should provide this information.},

abstract = {A common error in the electrical resistivity method occurs when a cable connecting to a current or potential electrode is inadvertently grounded at a point other than the intended electrode, thus creating an extra electrode. In this paper, we derive expressions for the magnitude of the induced error of the inadvertent electrode as a function of the position for a homogeneous infinite half-space for a general four-electrode array. We also derive a general expression for the magnitude of the error in terms of the current densities for ground with a general resistivity distribution. We compare the theoretical results for homogeneous ground with small-scale field surveys and find them to be in good agreement. We show that the error in the measured apparent resistivity has a value that is proportional to the apparent resistivity for an array made up of the inadvertent electrode and the electrode to which it is connected. We find that the induced error becomes very large if the additional electrode is a current electrode and it is placed near a potential electrode or if it is a potential electrode and it is placed near a current electrode. The magnitude of the error is the same whether the additional electrode is a current electrode or a potential electrode. The induced error approaches a constant non-zero value as the additional electrode is moved towards infinity. Resistivity heterogeneity in the ground can either increase or decrease the error depending on the sensitivity of the array formed by the inadvertent electrode and the electrode to which it is connected.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the efficiency and complementarity of a light package of geophysical techniques to study the structure of karst Unsaturated Zone (UZ) in typical Mediterranean environment where soil cover is thin or absent. Both selected techniques, 2D Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), are widely used in environmental studies and their application is accessible for a lot of scientists/engineers. However, GPR or ERT alone is not able to provide an enhanced characterization of geological features in karst media. In the present study, GPR results supply a near surface high resolution imaging and thus can provide relevant geological information such as stratifications and fractures. Despite the quality of the results GPR's investigation depth remains limited to around 12. m. Apparent and inverted resistivity provided by ERT surveys shows strong lateral and vertical variations. These variations can inform about general geological structuring and feature orientation. ERT is able to prospect down to 40. m but it's a low resolution integrative technique. In the study area the investigated limestone is a commonly electrical resistive formation (more than 2000 $\Omega$.m). However deeper than 5-7. m, the ERT profiles reveal several zones of moderate resistivity (around 900. $\Omega$.m). In these zones a stratification change corresponding to slanted bedding is clearly identified by GPR results. The combination of both GPR and ERT results can allow a well-established geological interpretation. These moderate resistivity zones with slanted beddings can explain the presence of a perennial water flow point 35. m below the surface of the studied site within the underground gallery of the Low-Noise Underground Laboratory (LSBB). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Resistivity and chargeability data were collected using a network of linear survey lines. The influence of array type and orientation was evaluated, and 2D and 3D inversion results were compared. Superior geometric and electrical property resolution of 3D models was achieved using dipole-dipole as compared to Wenner array data. 3D resistivity model resolution was shown to be sensitive to electrode array orientation, indicating that to ensure adequate resolution of strongly anisometric structures orthogonal electrode configurations should be employed. Quasi-3D models generated using 2D inversion showed a marked reduction in resolution relative to the corresponding 3D models, and were characterised by highly irregular and variable electrical property distributions. The results confirm that, subject to suitable survey design, 3D ET can provide spatial images that could significantly improve the detectability of buried man-made targets.},

abstract = {A grouting program to mitigate water inflow into a deep shaft at the Mosaic Potash Esterhazy operations was initiated based on 3D Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) from the shaft and historical geological information used to characterize conditions around the shaft. In 1986, installation of a grout wall was undertaken but not completed. Historical information from shaft logs during sinking and subsequent drilling during the 1986 grout wall installation indicated that fractures intersected the shaft where water inflows were observed. The 1986 grout project used acrylamide and urethane chemical grouts to reduce shaft seepage through a concrete liner from Devonian carbonate rocks. In 2004, a two dimensional ERI investigation was completed using 48 electrodes placed on a vertical line at 2 m spacing in the concrete shaft liner. The results of this survey matched geological information and a more extensive 3D ERI survey was undertaken in 2006. The 3D ERI investigation used three vertical electrode lines equally spaced around the circumference of the shaft (120 degree separation) with 134 electrodes along each line spaced at a 1 meter interval. This investigation provided the first and only information as to the extent of success and failure of the 1986 grouting operation in a carbonate system with matrix or intercrystalline, and fracture porosity. Since the ERI imaging surrounded the shaft, it helped to discriminate between both grouted and ungrouted rock. The ERI results provided sufficient evidence to support the completion of the grout wall in 2009. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a 3D ERI investigation for underground shaft work. We will discuss the grouting programs and the ERI process and results of the 3D model which revealed a significant contrast in grout penetration and the indication of linear features interpreted as open fluid transmitting fractures.},

abstract = {An algorithm for linear(ized) experimental design is developed for a determinant-based design objective function. This objective function is common in design theory and is used to design experiments that minimize the model entropy, a measure of posterior model uncertainty. Of primary significance in design problems is computational expediency. Several earlier papers have focused attention on posing design objective functions and opted to use global search methods for finding the critical points of these functions, but these algorithms are too slow to be practical. The proposed technique is distinguished primarily for its computational efficiency, which derives partly from a greedy optimization approach, termed sequential design. Computational efficiency is further enhanced through formulae for updating determinants and matrix inverses without need for direct calculation. The design approach is orders of magnitude faster than a genetic algorithm applied to the same design problem. However, greedy optimization often trades global optimality for increased computational speed; the ramifications of this tradeoff are discussed. The design methodology is demonstrated on a simple, single-borehole DC electrical resistivity problem. Designed surveys are compared with random and standard surveys, both with and without prior information. All surveys were compared with respect to a ‚Äòrelative quality' measure, the post-inversion model per cent rms error. The issue of design for inherently ill-posed inverse problems is considered and an approach for circumventing such problems is proposed. The design algorithm is also applied in an adaptive manner, with excellent results suggesting that smart, compact experiments can be designed in real time.},

Experiment design optimization requires that the quality of any particular design can be both quantified and then maximized. This study shows how the quality can be defined such that it depends on the amount of information that is focused in the particular subspace of interest. In addition, algorithms are presented which allow one particular focused quality measure (from the class of focused measures) to be evaluated efficiently. A subclass of focused quality measures is also related to the standard variance and resolution measures from linearized inverse theory. The theory presented here requires that the relationship between model parameters and data can be linearized around a reference model without significant loss of information. Physical and financial constraints define the space of possible experiment designs. Cross-well tomographic examples are presented, plus a strategy for survey design to maximize information about linear combinations of parameters such as bulk modulus, kappa = lambda + 2 mu/3.},

Five synthetic\ngeological models, simulating a buried channel, a narrow conductive\ndike, a narrow resistive dike, dipping blocks and covered waste ponds,\nwere used to examine the surveying efficiency (anomaly effects, signal-to-noise\nratios) and the imaging capabilities of these arrays. The responses\nto variations in the data density and noise sensitivities of these\nelectrode configurations were also investigated using robust (L-1-norm)\ninversion and smoothness-constrained least-squares (L-2-norm) inversion\nfor the five synthetic models. The results show the following. (i)\nGM and WN are less contaminated by noise than the other electrode\narrays. (ii) The relative anomaly effects for the different arrays\nvary with the geological models. However, the relatively high anomaly\neffects of PP, GM and WB surveys do not always give a high-resolution\nimage. PD, DD and GD can yield better resolution images than GM,\nPP, WN and WB, although they are more susceptible to noise contamination.\nSC is also a strong candidate but is expected to give more edge effects.\n(iii) The imaging quality of these arrays is relatively robust with\nrespect to reductions in the data density of a multi-electrode layout\nwithin the tested ranges. (iv) The robust inversion generally gives\nbetter imaging results than the L2-norm inversion, especially with\nnoisy data, except for the dipping block structure presented here.\n(v) GD and MPR are well suited to multichannel surveying and GD may\nproduce images that are comparable to those obtained with DD and\nPD. Accordingly, the GD, PD, DD and SC arrays are strongly recommended\nfor 2D resistivity imaging, where the final choice will be determined\nby the expected geology, the purpose of the survey and logistical\nconsiderations.},

abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography ({ERT)} monitoring experiments are being conducted more often to image spatiotemporal changes in soil properties. When conducting long-term {ERT} monitoring, the identification of suspicious electrodes in a permanent spread is of major importance because changes in electrode contact properties of a single electrode may affect the quality of many measurements on each time-slice. An automated methodology was developed to detect these temporal changes in electrode contact properties, based on a Bayesian approach called "weights of evidence." Contrasts (C-W) and studentized contrasts (C-S) are estimators of the influence of each electrode in the global data quality. A consolidated studentized contrast ({CCS)} is introduced to consider the proportion of rejected quadripoles which contain a single electrode. These estimators are computed for each time-slice using Q-factor (coefficient of variation of repeated measurements) threshold values, from 0 to 10%, to discriminate between selected and rejected quadripoles. An automated detection strategy is proposed to identify suspicious electrodes by comparing the {CCS} to the {MECS} (maximum expected C-S values when every electrode is good for the given data set). These {MECS} are computed using Monte-Carlo simulations of a hundred random draws where the distribution of Q-factor values follows a Weibull cumulative distribution, with k = 0.421 and lambda = 1.303, fitted on a background data set filtered using a 5% threshold on absolute reciprocal errors. The efficiency of the methodology and its sensitivity to the selected reciprocal error threshold are assessed on synthetic and field data. Our approach is suitable to detect suspicious electrodes and slowly changing conditions affecting the galvanic contact resistances where classical approaches are shown to be inadequate except when the faulty electrode is disconnected. A data-weighting method is finally proposed to ensure that only good data will be used in the inversion of {ERT} monitoring data sets.},

abstract = {Inconsistencies between an object and its image delivered by tomographical methods are inevitable. Loss of information occurs during the survey through incomplete and inaccurate data sampling and may also be introduced during the inverse procedure by smoothness constraints inadequate to the resolving power of the experimental setup. A quantitative appraisal of image quality (spatial resolution and image noise) is therefore not only required for successful interpretation of images but can be used together with measures of efficiency of the experimental design to optimize survey and inverse procedures. This paper introduces a low-contrast inversion scheme for electrical resistivity tomography that supports the reconstructed image with estimates of model resolution, model covariance and data importance. The algorithm uses a truncated pseudo-inverse and a line search approach to determine the maximum number of degrees of freedom necessary to fit the data to a prescribed target misfit. Though computationally expensive, the virtue of the method is that it reduces subjectivity by avoiding any empirically motivated model smoothness constraints. The method can be incorporated into a full non-linear inversion scheme for which a posteriori quality estimates can be calculated. In a numerical 2-D example the algorithm yielded reasonable agreement between object and image even for moderate resistivity contrasts of 10:100:1000. On the other hand, the resolving power of an exemplary four-electrode data set containing classical dipole-dipole and non-conventional configurations was shown to be severely affected by data inaccuracy. Insight into the resolving power as a function of space and data accuracy can be used as a guideline to designing optimized data sets, smoothness constraints and model parametrization.},

abstract = {In early 1987, the Patience Lake potash mine near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, was closed due to uncontrollable flooding. Water inflows were first encountered during routine mining in 1975 at the south boundary of the mine lease. Underground grouting and construction of bulkheads limited the flow but did not completely stop it. Subsequent seismic surveys showed that the mine had approached the edge of a large collapse structure in which the salt and potash had been partly dissolved and removed by groundwater. In 1986, the small flow into the mine started to grow. Despite renewed grouting, the flood increased and outstripped pump capacity. The grouting program temporarily slowed the inflow but was unable to stop it. Eventually, from seismic and drilling evidence, it became clear that the water source was an extensive system of vertical fractures which would be impossible to seal by drilling and grouting from underground. A new plan to install 14 bulkheads underground would have sealed the water source from the rest of the mine but the construction program could not be completed before rapidly increasing inflows threatened to fill the mine. The underground mine was closed and a new solution mine started in 1988.},

An electrode array was installed near the end of the first section of the gallery in order to monitor the evolution of the EDZ at the restart of the excavation works. Data sets acquired at different time intervals show conspicuous changes of the electrical resistivity. Forward modelling of a data subset indicates resistivity variations from 6¬†$\Omega$¬†m for undamaged Opalinus clay to 45¬†$\Omega$¬†m in the most damaged zones. Comparison with geological observations shows that the resistivity changes are strongly controlled by the local tectonics and by the bedding in the rock formation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For both experimental design and interpretation of inversion results it is useful to analyze resolution power and model uncertainties. The model resolution matrix can significantly help to understand the quality of the inversion process. On this basis, it is possible to find measures for information content and efficiency of data sets depending on the noise level. On the other hand, it is possible to investigate how different inversion and regularization schemes affect resolution power. The singular value decomposition (svd) can be used to calculate generalized inverse matrices, which lead to resolution matrices for truncated svd (tsvd) inversion and Tikhonov regularization. With some additional effort, a generalized svd (gsvd) can also be applied to arbitrary model restrictions like smoothness constraints. For reasons of comparability, a one step linearized inversion scheme is applied. Whereas tsvd and Tikhonov regularization rather produce noise artifacts, smooth- ness constraints and weighting by coverage tend to produce artifacts near the boundaries. As far as the comparison of data sets is concerned, the highest information contents are achieved using pole-dipole and dipole-dipole configurations, the lowest ones us- ing pole-pole and Wenner type arrays. In all cases enlarged dipole lengths for large separations and augmented data sets using so called circulated data significantly increase the information content.},

The difficulties encountered include handling solution discontinuities across interfaces and accelerating convergence of traditional iterative methods for the solution of the linear systems of algebraic equations that arise when discretizing Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. We use a potential-current formulation (A, $\phi$, ƒ¥) with a Coulomb gauge. The potentials A and $\phi$ decompose the electric field E into components in the active and null spaces of the ‚àá x operator. We develop a finite volume discretization on a staggered grid that naturally employs harmonic averages for the conductivity at cell faces. After discretization, we eliminate the current and the resulting large, sparse, linear system of equations has a block structure that is diagonally dominant, allowing an efficient solution with preconditioned Krylov space methods. A particularly efficient algorithm results from the combination of BICGSTAB and an incomplete LU-decomposition. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in several numerical experiments.},

abstract = {The equivalence problem in geoelectrical data interpretation is a well-known fact. Generally, the equivalence analysis is implemented into 1D data inversion software but completely neglected in 2D data interpretation. In this paper, we present a practical approach to the problem of equivalence in a 2D data inversion. A 1D interpretation with equivalence analysis of the data is used to generate different starting models for a 2D inversion. At suitable locations, sounding curves are extracted from the 2D data set and inverted. Calculation of equivalent 1D results is carried out at each sounding point. The different resulting models are connected laterally to form different starting models for a 2D inversion of the complete 2D data set. Our 2D inversion results, similar in terms of data fit, but very different regarding the resulting resistivity distributions, enforce the necessity to carry out equivalence analysis in 2D data interpretations. It is shown that the implementation of a 1D interpretation of a 2D data set of predominantly layered structures provides a suitable way to introduce a first-order equivalence analysis to the problem in 2D. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

This can be achieved through matrix solution of a simple set of simultaneous conditions that any primary magnetic field must not penetrate the target body. In airborne EM (AEM) data acquisition, hundreds of local anomalies may need to be interpreted each day of flying, and the inductive limit modeling algorithm provides a useful and very fast model for realistic target geometries. In particular, it allows typical single-peaked field anomalies in the vertical component of fixed-wing AEM systems to be fitted, using a multifaceted solid body. Thin-plate models, which are commonly used, produce "M-shaped" responses rarely seen in field data.},

abstract = {Understanding the deformation processes in potash mines is very important for safe mining, planning the methods of extracting the orebody, and the prevention of catastrophic water inflow. A variety of deformational structures are present in the Upper Kama potash deposit. Folding is a dominant and most common form of deformation of ductile evaporites (herein also referred to as salts). Brittle deformation occurs rarely but is of more significance from the perspective of mine safety because fractures affect the supporting capability of mine pillars and can provide passageway for water inflow. Continuous common offset ground penetrating radar (GPR) data were acquired in the potash mine operated by the Joint Stock Company (JSC) "Silvinit" to investigate a set of pre-existing fractures and related deformational structures. Open fractures, faults and folds were mapped using 2-D and 3-D GPR techniques. Detection of millimetric scale fractures was available due to high salt/air dielectric properties contrast and low background noise within uniform salt rock. FK filtering significantly improved fracture detection and imaging. A spatial model of one set of fractures was created using 3-D GPR imaging. Migration was applied to GPR data to obtain the true geometry of the strongly folded salt beds. The results of studies showed that GPR is capable of providing valuable information about deformation within the evaporite formations of the Upper Kama potash deposit. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Underground excavations provoke in their vicinity a region, where the rock is disturbed, i.e., loosened due to micro as well as macro fractures. Shape, dimension and properties of this so-called 'excavation damaged zone (EDZ)' are of increasing importance for the planning and construction of geotechnical barriers in underground repositories for toxic and problematic wastes. One way of assessing the EDZ around a drift is the investigation of the geoelectrical complex resistivity. In addition to resistivity, the phase measurements yield information about the pore spaces and not only about the water content. Measurements of resistivity and phase are conducted in a newly built tunnel in the opalinus claystone of the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory. Special ring profiles, as well as a geometry-adapted inversion scheme, are used. Significant local and temporal changes are found in the resistivity as well in the phase, which are directly associated with the disturbed rock zone. Laboratory measurements allow the correlation and quantification of resistivity and water saturation of the rock. A geotechnical modelling and an analysis of the stress pattern around the drift show that the geoelectrical properties agree remarkable with the mechanical state of the rock. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This research provides an empirical study of electrodes used to measure galvanic resistivity. The central element of this work is an estimation of errors in resistivity measure- ments that arise because of the type of electrode material used. Fourteen types of electrodes were tested including metal electrodes, metal-salt-compound (nonpolarizing) elec- trodes, and one nonmetal electrode, under conditions that are typical of those encountered during geophysical surveys. Measurement errors for resistance and chargeability were es- timated using the reciprocity of data from an array of electrodes such as might be used for electric-resistance tomography. The same error analysis was applied to data from a network of high-precision resistors to separate instrument errors from electrode errors. Significant differences were observed in errors produced by different electrode materials.We conclude that the choice of electrode is very important for resistivity or chargeability surveys. Iron, steel (including rebar), lead, and phosphor bronze produced the smallest errors in resistance and chargeability. Aluminum, magnesium, titanium, copper, and zinc produced the largest errors. Stainless steel (alloy 316), tin, and brass performed reasonably well, as did carbon, which was the only nonmetal tested.},

We apply an original methodology for defining the inversion parametrization based on pilot points to better deal with the heterogeneous sounding of the medium. An increased region of high spatial resolution is shown by analysis of point spread functions as well as inversion of synthetics. Such evaluations highlight the advantages of using transmission measurements by transferring a few electrodes from the main profile to increase the sounding depth.

abstract = {Detecting, real-time monitoring and early warning of underground water-bearing structures are critically important issues in prevention and mitigation of water inrush hazards in underground engineering. Direct current (DC) resistivity method is a widely used method for routine detection, advanced detection and real-time monitoring of water-bearing structures, due to its high sensitivity to groundwater. In this study, the DC resistivity method applied to underground engineering is reviewed and discussed, including the observation mode, multiple inversions, and real-time monitoring. It is shown that a priori information constrained inversion is desirable to reduce the non-uniqueness of inversion, with which the accuracy of detection can be significantly improved. The focused resistivity method is prospective for advanced detection; with this method, the flanking interference can be reduced and the detection distance is increased subsequently. The time-lapse resistivity inversion method is suitable for the regions with continuous conductivity changes, and it can be used to monitor water inrush in those regions. Based on above-mentioned features of various methods in terms of benefits and limitations, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) induced polarization method characterized with multi-electrode array, and introduce it into tunnels and mines combining with real-time monitoring with time-lapse inversion and cross-hole resistivity method. At last, the prospective applications of DC resistivity method are discussed as follows: (1) available advanced detection technology and instrument in tunnel excavated by tunnel boring machine (TBM), (2) high-resolution detection method in holes, (3) four-dimensional (4D) monitoring technology for water inrush sources, and (4) estimation of water volume in water-bearing structures.},

abstract = {The use of optimized arrays generated using the ‚ÄòCompare R' method for crossborehole resistivity measurements is examined in this paper. We compare the performances of two array optimization algorithms, one that maximizes the model resolution and another that minimizes the point spread value. Although both algorithms give similar results, the model resolution maximization algorithm is several times faster. A study of the point spread function plots for a cross-borehole survey shows that the model resolution within the central zone surrounded by the borehole electrodes is much higher than near the bottom end of the boreholes. Tests with synthetic and experimental data show that the optimized arrays generated by the ‚ÄòCompare R' method have significantly better resolution than a ‚Äòstandard' measurement sequence used in previous surveys. The resolution of the optimized arrays is less if arrays with both current (or both potential) electrodes in the same borehole are excluded. However, they are still better than the ‚Äòstandard' arrays.},

abstract = {Previous studies show that optimized arrays generated using the 'Compare R' method have significantly better resolution than conventional arrays. This method determines the optimum set of arrays by selecting those that give the maximum model resolution. The number of possible arrays (the comprehensive data set) increases with the fourth power of the number of electrodes. The optimization method faces practical limitations for 2-D survey lines with more than 60 electrodes where the number of possible arrays exceeds a million. Several techniques are proposed to reduce the calculation time for such survey lines. A single-precision version of the 'Compare R' algorithm using a new ranking function reduces the calculation time by two to eight times while providing results similar to the double-precision version. Recent improvements in computer GPU technology can reduce the calculation time by about seven times. The calculation time is reduced by half by using the fact that arrays that are symmetrical about the center of the line produce identical changes in the model resolution values. It is further reduced by more than thirty times by calculating the Sherman-Morrison update for all the possible two-electrode combinations, which are then used to calculate the model resolution values for the four-electrode arrays. The calculation time is reduced by more then ten times by using a subset of the comprehensive data set consisting of only symmetrical arrays. Tests with a synthetic model and field data set show that optimized arrays derived from this subset produce inversion models with differences of less than 10% from those derived using the full comprehensive data set. The optimized data sets produced models that are more accurate than the Wenner-Schlumberger array data sets in all the tests.},

abstract = {The ‚ÄòCompare R' method is used to automatically generate optimized arrays for two-dimensional resistivity surveys with electrodes arranged along parallel lines on the surface and the subsurface. The resolution at depth is greatly improved by carrying out measurements with at least one line of electrodes below the surface using a direct push installation technique. The performance of the optimized arrays is compared with a standard measurement sequence created manually that was used for previous surveys. Tests were conducted using a synthetic model and a field survey in an area with karst geology that has some ground truth. Both tests show that the optimized arrays have significantly better resolution compared with a standard measurement sequence. We also show that artefacts in the inversion model can be reduced by using higher damping factors near the positions of the subsurface electrodes.},

abstract = {Survey design ultimately dictates the quality of subsurface information provided by practical implementations of geophysical methods. It is therefore critical to design experimental procedures that cost effectively produce those data that maximize the desired information. This review cites recent advances in statistical experimental design techniques applied in the earth sciences. Examples from geoelectrical, crosswell and surface seismic, and microseismic monitoring methods are included. Using overdetermined 1D and 2D geoelectrical examples, a minor subset of judiciously chosen measurements provides a large percentage of the information content theoretically offered by the geoelectrical method. In contrast, an underdetermined 2D seismic traveltime tomography design study indicates that the information content increases almost linearly with the amount of traveltime data (source-receiver pairs) considered until the underdeterminancy is reduced substantially. An experimental design study of frequency-domain seismic-waveform inversion experiments reveals that a few optimally chosen frequencies offer as much subsurface information as the full bandwidth. A nonlinear experimental design for a seismic amplitude-versus-angle survey identifies those incidence angles most important for characterizing a reservoir. A nonlinear design example shows that designing microseismic monitoring surveys based on array aperture is a poor strategy that almost certainly leads to suboptimal designs.},

abstract = {A fundamental step in the solution of most non-linear inverse problems is to establish a relationship between changes in a proposed model and resulting changes in the forward mod- elled data. Once this relationship has been established, it becomes possible to refine an initial model to obtain an improved fit to the observed data. In a linearized analysis, the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative is the connecting link between changes in the model and changes in the data. In some simple cases an analytic expression for the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative may be derived. In this paper we present three techniques to accomplish this and illustrate them by computing the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative for the 1D resistivity problem. For more complicated problems, where it is not possible to obtain an expression for the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative, it is necessary to parameterize the model and solve numerically for the sensitivities - partial derivatives of the data with respect to model parameters. The standard perturbation method for computing first-order sensitivities is discussed and compared to the more efficient sensitivity-equation and adjoint- equation methods. Extensions to allow for the calculation of higher order, directional and objective function sensitivities are also presented. Finally, the application of these various techniques is illustrated for both the 1D and 2D resistivity problems.},

This is referred to here as injection electrode overprinting. Overprinting may occur in resistivity measurements when an electrode is used as a receiving electrode immediately following duty as an injection electrode, such as in multi-electrode systems with automatic switching. The circumstances that produce overprinting are demonstrated here and recommendations are made to limit its occurrence and effect. It is found that the overvoltage on injection electrodes is unlikely to exceed a few volts and that the period of rapid, nonlinear, decay is over in a few seconds. Most modern resistivity equipment can easily accommodate potentials with these characteristics as part of spontaneous potential rejection.

It is a complicated geophysical task often at the limit of detection. Nevertheless geophysical investigation is the only alternative to a dense and expensive grid of boreholes. This report tests the usefulness of geoelectrical resistivity methods for cavity detection under some new aspects. The basis for evaluation was a theoretical analysis of different con- ventional and focussing measuring arrays and of special arra.ys for a geoelectrical research between two boreholes. The limit of detectability of a cylindrical cavity of defined cross-section and depth was calculated for the different measuring arrays on the basis of computation of the apparent resistivity pa. Furthermore, the influence of possible errors (current supply of the elec- trodes and the distance between the electrodes) is discussed for focussed systems. The second part of the article is directed at the behaviour of the apparent resistivity pa, the disturbing potential SVd caused by the cavity and the normal potential $\sim$VO of the measuring array all in relation to a homogeneous earth. Some new results are presented. In the last part of the article theoretical results are compared with some field measure- ments.},

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Practical decisions are often made based on the subsurface  images obtained by inverting geophysical data. Therefore it is important to understand the resolution of the image, which is a function of several factors, including the underlying geophysical experiment, noise in the data, prior information and the ability to model the physics appropriately. An important step towards interpreting the image is to quantify how much of the solution is required to satisfy the data observations and how much exists solely due to the prior information used to stabilize the solution. A procedure to identify the regions that are not constrained by the data would help when interpreting the image. For linear inverse problems this procedure is well established, but for non-linear problems the procedure is more complicated. In this paper we compare two different approaches to resolution analysis of geophysical images: the region of data influence index and a resolution spread computed using point spread functions. The region of data influence method is a fully non-linear approach, while the point spread function analysis is a linearized approach. An approximate relationship between the region of data influence and the resolution matrix is derived, which suggests that the region of data influence is connected with the rows of the resolution matrix. The point-spread-function spread measure is connected with the columns of the resolution matrix, and therefore the point-spread-function spread and the region of data influence are fundamentally different resolution measures. From a practical point of view, if two different approaches indicate similar interpretations on post-inversion images, the confidence in the interpretation is enhanced. We demonstrate the use of the two approaches on a linear synthetic example and a non-linear synthetic example, and apply them to a non-linear electromagnetic field data example.},

abstract = {While a potash mine experiencing water inflow problems might sound like an ideal candidate for a DC resistivity survey because of the large conductivity contrast between the wet salt or briny water (0.1 - 20 S/m) and the surrounding dry salt (1e-5 - 0.01 S/m), this environment poses a number of survey design challenges. Unlike surface applications where a dense grid of transmitters and receivers can be deployed to maximize model resolution within the region of interest, the subterranean environment often limits the location of transmitters and receivers to existing tunnels or boreholes. This can significantly reduce model resolution and create non-uniqueness issues in regions where the survey lacks the sensitivity to properly sample the target region. When collecting DC data along a straight section of tunnel, conventional surveys consist of a single linear array of electrodes placed along one face of the tunnel. While a 2D array of this type can often constrain the along tunnel location of a potential target it lacks the ability to resolve the target's around tunnel location or how far the target is away from the tunnel. Similar challenges arise with more complex tunnel geometries if most of the transmitters and receivers fall on or near the same depth plane. In this situation it may be difficult or impossible to determine where the anomalous bodies are located relative to the measurement plane. To improve the resolution of the recovered model, we used ring arrays with one or more electrodes in each face of the tunnel. Through several simple synthetic examples, we demonstrated that the ring array survey better constrains the location and shape of anomalous bodies. Since ring arrays utilize far more electrodes than conventional linear arrays, we developed a survey design methodology to balance improvements in model resolution with survey size.},

The primary field of the loop will induce eddy currents in all conductors present in the earth. The secondary electromagnetic (EM) fields due to these induced currents, together with the primary EM field, are recorded with a suitable receiver at various points in space. In general, the secondary EM field at the receiver, which contains all the information regarding the underground conductors, may be several orders of magnitude smaller than the primary field. Under these conditions the separation of the measured total EM field into its primary and secondary parts is difficult.},

abstract = {Limitations of imaging using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) arise because of the difficulty of quantifying the reliability of tomographic images. A major source of uncertainty in tomographic inversion is data error. Data error due to electrode mislocations is characterized by the sensitivity of electrical potential to both source and receiver positions. This sensitivity is described by a scattering-type equation and, therefore, depends not only on source--receiver separation, but also on the location and magnitude of contrasts in electrical conductivity. At the overlapping scales of near-surface environmental and engineering geophysical surveys, for which electrodes may be close to the target and experiment dimensions may be on the same order as those of the target, errors associated with electrode mislocations can significantly contaminate the ERT data and the reconstructed electrical conductivity. For synthetic experiments, variations in the data due to electrode mislocation are comparable in magnitude to typical experimental noise levels and, in some cases, may overwhelm variations in the data due to changes in material properties. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of electrode mislocation errors can be complicated and multimodal such that bias may be introduced into the ERT data. The resulting perturbations of the reconstructed electrical conductivity field due to electrode mislocations can be significant in magnitude with complex spatial distributions that are dependent both on the model and the experiment.},

abstract = {Realistic geologic features are 3-D and inverse techniques which rely upon linearization and computation of a sensitivity matrix to show how a change in the model affects a particular datum, can require prohibitive amounts of computation. Even 10(4) data collected over an earth parametrized into 10(2) x 10(2) x 10(2) elements has a sensitivity matrix which is 10(4) x 10(6). The generation of that matrix requires the solution of many 3-D forward problems and its solution is also computationally intensive. In this paper we formulate a general technique for solving large-scale inverse problems which does not involve full linearization and which can obviate the need to solve a large system of equations. The method uses accurate forward modelling to compute responses, but only uses an approximate inverse mapping to map data back to model space. The approximate inverse mapping is chosen with emphasis on the physics of the problem and on computational expediency. There are two ways to implement the AIM (Approximate Inverse Mapping) inversion. At any iteration step, AIM-MS applies the approximate inverse mapping to forward modelled data and also applies the same mapping to the observations; the model perturbation is taken as the difference between the resulting functions. In AIM-DS, an alteration to the data is sought, such that the approximate inverse mapping applied to the altered data yields a model which adequately satisfies the observations. The approximate mapping inversion is illustrated with a simple parametric inverse problem and with the inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data to recover a 1-D conductivity model. To illustrate the technique in a realistically complicated problem we invert MT data acquired from a line of stations over a 2-D conductivity structure. TE and TM mode data are inverted individually and as determinant averages. As a final example we invert 900 data, with and without noise, to recover a model that is parametrized by 1500 cells of unknown conductivity. The inversion is found to be computationally efficient and robust.},

Of particular interest are frequency and time domain EM problems involving controlled sources. In our work Maxwell's equations are discretized with finite volume methods and solved iteratively or, more recently, by using direct solvers. The physical properties of most interest are the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, and data are acquired in the quasi-static regime. For zero frequency, Maxwell's equations reduce to the DC resistivity equations and these play an important role in mineral exploration and in problems such as finding water near mine tunnels. Our 3D frequency and time domain EM inversions have been successful in mineral exploration problems involving airborne and surface transmitters and airborne, surface and downhole receivers. These codes and methodologies for inversion should also be successful in research problems connected with the LSBB where transmitters and receivers are in tunnels or boreholes.},

abstract = {We have developed an open source 3D, MATLAB based, resistivity inversion package. The forward solution to the governing partial differential equation is efficiently computed using a second-order finite volume discretization coupled with a preconditioned, biconjugate, stabilized gradient algorithm. Using the analytical solution to a potential field in a homogeneous half space, we evaluate the accuracy of our numerical forward solution and, subsequently, develop a source correction factor that reduces forward modeling errors associated with boundary effects and source electrode singularities. For the inversion algorithm we have implemented an inexact Gauss-Newton solver, with the model update being calculated using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The inversion uses a combination of zero and first order Tikhonov regularization. Two synthetic examples demonstrate the usefulness of this code. The first example considers a surface resistivity survey with 3813 measurements. The discretized model space contains 19,040 cells. For this example, the inversion package converges in approximately 25 minutes on a 2.8Ghz Pentium 4, with 4, Gb of RAM. The second example considers the case of borehole based data acquisition. For this example there were 4704 measurements and 13,200 model cells. The inversion for this example requires 20 minutes of computational time. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work.

abstract = {Electrical imaging of tracer tests can provide valuable information on the spatial variability of solute transport processes. This concept was investigated by cross-borehole electrical imaging of a controlled release in an experimental tank. A saline tracer (conductivity 8 X 103 ms/m volume 2701) was injected into a tank facility (dimensions 10 X 10 X 3 m) consisting of alternating sand and clay layers. Injection was from 0.3 m below the surface, at a point where maximum interaction between tank structure and tracer transport was expected. Repeated imaging over a two-week period detected non-uniform tracer transport, partly caused by the sand/clay sequence. Tracery accumulation on two clay layers was observed and density-driven spill of tracer over a clay shelf was imaged. An additional unexpected flow pathway, probably caused by complications during array installation, was identified close to an electrode array. Pore water samples obtained following termination of electrical imaging generally supported the observed electrical response, although discrepancies arose when analysing the response of individual pixels. The pixels that make up the electrical images were interpreted as a large number of breakthrough curves. The shape of the pixel breakthrough-recession curve allowed some quantitative interpretation of solute travel time, as well as a qualitative assessment of spatial variability in advective-dispersive transport characteristics across the image plane. Although surface conduction effects associated with the clay layers complicated interpretation, the plotting of pixel breakthroughs was considered a useful step in the hydrological interpretation of the tracer test. The spatial coverage provided by the high density of pixels is the factor that most encourages the approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Four different methods of determining the DC sensitivity in three dimensions are presented: three numerical approaches for arbitrary conductivity structures and an analytical one for a homogeneous case using the sensitivity theorem. Since the sensitivity is a very important and indicative property in any interpretation process, its spatial distribution is shown as an overview for commonly used pole-pole, pole-dipole, and dipole-dipole arrangements at the surface and subsurface. Distinct regions of negative sensitivities appear for any configuration. For horizontal subsurface pole-pole configurations, they assume tube-like, cylindrical shapes stretching from the electrode locations towards the surface and yielding a circular sign-reversal pattern at the surface. These shapes and sign reversals occur as long as the electrodes are located at a finite depth. Similar forms occur for subsurface pole-dipole and dipole-dipole arrangements. A series of model studies are carried out to examine the validity of the homogeneous responses for more realistic inhomogeneous media. Generally, the spatial sensitivity patterns for homogeneous environments are good approximations for moderate conductivity contrasts not exceeding 1:10 if the source is located within conductive material. If the source is buried within a resistor, conductive structures perturb the homogeneous pattern more significantly. Finally, a crosshole model study reveals significant differences between 2-D and 3-D conductive bodies, suggesting a need to examine the target very carefully before approximating some structures in two dimensions.},

The experimental design algorithm includes a goodness function that ranks the sensitivity of every possible electrode configuration to changes in the subsurface parameters. To examine the potential and limitations of the new algorithm, comprehensive data sets that included data from all standard and nonstandard electrode configurations were (a) generated for a complex 2D resistivity model and (b) recorded across a well-studied test site in Switzerland. Images determined from the resultant comprehensive data sets were used as benchmarks against which the images derived from the optimized data sets were assessed. Images from relatively small optimized data sets, containing 265‚Äì282 data points, provided more information than did those from standard data sets of equal size.Byfar the best images, comparable to those determined from the much larger comprehensive data sets, were obtained from optimized data sets with 1000‚Äì6000 data points. These images supplied reliable information over depth ranges that were three times greater than the depth ranges resolved by the standard images. The first ‚àº600 electrode configurations selected by the experimental design procedure were nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays, whereas the following ‚àº4800 electrode configurations were an approximately equal mix of nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays and nested configurations (i.e., mostly gradient and other nonstandard arrays).},

abstract = {Measurement errors can play a pivotal role in geophysical inversion. Most inverse models require users to prescribe or assume a statistical model of data errors before inversion. Wrongly prescribed errors can lead to over- or under-fitting of data; however, the derivation of models of data errors is often neglected. With the heightening interest in uncertainty estimation within hydrogeophysics, better characterisation and treatment of measurement errors is needed to provide improved image appraisal. Here we focus on the role of measurement errors in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). We have analysed two time-lapse ERT datasets: one contains 96 sets of direct and reciprocal data collected from a surface ERT line within a 24 h timeframe; the other is a two-year-long cross-borehole survey at a UK nuclear site with 246 sets of over 50,000 measurements. Our study includes the characterisation of the spatial and temporal behaviour of measurement errors using autocorrelation and correlation coefficient analysis. We find that, in addition to well-known proportionality effects, ERT measurements can also be sensitive to the combination of electrodes used, i.e. errors may not be uncorrelated as often assumed. Based on these findings, we develop a new error model that allows grouping based on electrode number in addition to fitting a linear model to transfer resistance. The new model explains the observed measurement errors better and shows superior inversion results and uncertainty estimates in synthetic examples. It is robust, because it groups errors together based on the electrodes used to make the measurements. The new model can be readily applied to the diagonal data weighting matrix widely used in common inversion methods, as well as to the data covariance matrix in a Bayesian inversion framework. We demonstrate its application using extensive ERT monitoring datasets from the two aforementioned sites.},

abstract = {Several measurement arrangements involving different electrode arrays are considered for the case of single borehole-to-surface ERT surveys. Synthetic data tests indicate that standard measuring and inversion techniques can result in reconstructed images that suffer from artefacts. Based on the measurement sensitivity analysis, we propose a modified inversion scheme that compensates for the symmetric sensitivity of the in-hole measurements and improves the quality of the image. The new scheme has been tested using both synthetic and field data. The best results were obtained using pole-dipole or dipole-dipole arrays. Finally, some recommendations are made to improve the efficiency of field measurement configurations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nanjing Geophysical Research Institute.},

abstract = {Within geoelectrical imaging, the choice of measurement configurations and electrode loca- tions is known to control the image resolution. Previouswork has shown that optimized survey designs can provide a model resolution that is superior to standard survey designs. This paper demonstrates a methodology to optimize resolution within a target area, while limiting the number of required electrodes, thereby selecting optimal electrode locations. This is achieved by extending previous work on the ‚ÄòCompare-R' algorithm, which by calculating updates to the resolution matrix optimizes the model resolution in a target area. Here, an additional weighting factor is introduced that allows to preferentially adding measurement configurations that can be acquired on a given set of electrodes. The performance of the optimization is tested on two synthetic examples and verified with a laboratory study. The effect of the weighting factor is investigated using an acquisition layout comprising a single line of electrodes. The results show that an increasing weight decreases the area of improved resolution, but leads to a smaller number of electrode positions. Imaging results superior to a standard survey design were achieved using 56 per cent fewer electrodes. The performance was also tested on a 3-D acquisition grid, where superior resolution within a target at the base of an embankment was achieved using 22 per cent fewer electrodes than a comparable standard survey. The effect of the underlying resistivity distribution on the performance of the optimization was investigated and it was shown that even strong resistivity contrasts only have minor impact. The synthetic results were verified in a laboratory tank experiment, where notable image improvements were achieved. This work shows that optimized surveys can be designed that have a resolu- tion superior to standard survey designs, while requiring significantly fewer electrodes. This methodology thereby provides a means for improving the efficiency of geoelectrical imaging.},

With regard to the monitoring responsibility of site operators and the substantial expenses associated with permanent downhole installations, optimized experimental design gains particular importance. Based on an iterative appraisal of the formal model resolution matrix, we developed a method to estimate optimum electrode locations along the borehole trajectories with the objective to maximize the imaging capability within a prescribed target horizon. For the presented crosshole case, these layouts were found to be symmetric, exhibiting refined electrode spacings within the target horizon. Our results revealed that a sparse but well conceived set of electrodes can provide a large part of the information content offered by comparably dense electrode distributions.

abstract = {This paper describes a multi-plane implementation of a current-pulse electrical resistance tomography (ERT) data capture system. This is achieved by extending a single plane system, with 16 electrodes and 16 parallel measurement channels, to a one capable of acquiring data in a specified sequence across multiple planes (up to eight) by inserting multiplexer modules in parallel between the instrument and the electrode array. This approach allows high-speed capture systems to be configured for applications such as dual plane cross-correlation velocity measurements or more complex current injection and measurement sequences yielding 3D data sets. The measurement timing and multiplexer measurement sequences are implemented by an embedded processor. Both the executable code and the measurement sequence tables are downloaded to the instrument at start-up. This allows flexibility in specifying the data acquisition sequences and timing required for specific applications without modification of the hardware or embedded code. The effect of measurement noise on the estimated conductivity is quantified and spatial resolution discussed for the case of a 2D online imaging algorithm. Example reconstructions from recorded data sets are presented which verify the operation of the instrument.},

abstract = {The use of optimised resistivity tomography surveys to acquire field data imposes extra constraints on the design strategy beyond maximising the quality of the resulting tomographic image. In this paper, methods are presented to 1) minimise electrode polarisation effects; 2) make efficient use of parallel measurement channels; and 3) incorporate data noise estimates in the optimisation process. 1) A simulated annealing algorithm is used to rearrange the optimised measurement sequences to minimise polarisation errors. The method is developed using random survey designs, and is demonstrated to be effective for use with single and multi-channel optimised surveys. 2) An optimisation algorithm is developed to design surveys by successive addition of multi-channel groups of measurements rather than individual electrode configurations. The multi-channel surveys are shown to produce results nearly as close to optimal as equivalent single channel surveys, while reducing data collection times by an order of magnitude. 3) Random errors in the data are accounted for by weighting the electrode configurations in the optimisation process according to a simple error model incorporating background and voltage-dependent noise. The use of data weighting produces optimised surveys that are more robust in the presence of noise, while maintaining as much of the image resolution of the noise-free designs as possible. All the new methods described in this paper are demonstrated using both synthetic and real data, the latter having been measured on an active landslide using a permanently installed geoelectrical monitoring system.},

@article{Wilkinson2006a,
abstract = {Two strategies are presented for obtaining the maximum spatial resolution in electrical resistivity tomography surveys using a limited number of four-electrode measurement configurations. Both methods use a linearized estimate of the model resolution matrix to assess the effects of including a given electrode configuration in the measurement set. The algorithms are described in detail, and their execution times are analysed in terms of the number of cells in the inverse model. One strategy directly compares the model resolution matrices to optimize the spatial resolution. The other uses approximations based on the distribution and linear independence of the Jacobian matrix elements. The first strategy produces results that are nearer to optimal, however the second is several orders of magnitude faster. Significantly however, both offer better optimization performance than a similar, previously published, method. Realistic examples are used to compare the results of each algorithm. Synthetic data are generated for each optimized set of electrodes using simple forward models containing resistive and/or conductive prisms. By inverting the data, it is demonstrated that the linearized model resolution matrix yields a good estimate of the actual resolution obtained in the inverted image. Furthermore, comparison of the inversion results confirms that the spatial distribution of the estimated model resolution is a reliable indicator of tomographic image quality.},

abstract = {The safety of an underground waste disposal site depends to a large extent on the presence and migration of the water in the rock. Geoelectrics is the most suitable method particularly in underground mining conditions to explore and monitor the moist zones in many different rocks. Recent developments in hardware, inversion schemes and petrophysical interpretation of the resistivity enable reliable and useful measurements to be conducted with direct current geoelectrics for exploration and monitoring also in salt rock environment with rather high resistivities and resistivity changes. Examples are presented for resistivity exploration and monitoring in rock salt. The measurements are carried out in the research mine Asse in North Germany which is used for investigations into handling, storage, disposal and geological interaction of nuclear waste. A fully automated geoelectric system suitable for salt rock environment and long-term monitoring was used with a large number of electrodes installed permanently. Logistical conditions allow measurements only in profiles so that two-dimensional inversion schemes had to be used and their suitability and limitations are shown. At one site where the moisture is visible in a limited area at the wall the extension of the moist zone in the rock is explored and determined. This helps to estimate the possible changes that might occur in future and which measures have to be taken. At another site in a large area in the rock salt the resistivity has been monitored over several months. The resistivity distribution in the area shows local variations indicating changes in the state of rock salt which is otherwise usually homogeneous. The changes are related to disturbed rock zone at near surface around the voids due to the stress induced by the mining, to the neighbouring cavities and also disturbed zones in the deeper rock due to the stress redistribution in the last 30 years since the excavations took place. Also significant changes of resistivity with time are detected for which an estimate of water content can be given. These are attributed to fluctuations of the water content in the disturbed rock areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
