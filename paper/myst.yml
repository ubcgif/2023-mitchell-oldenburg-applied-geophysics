  title: Using DC Resistivity Ring Array Surveys to Resolve Conductive Structures Around Tunnels or Mine-Workings
  description: We propose the use of an ensemble of ring arrays, which are created by placing one or more electrodes in each face (sidewalls, floor, and ceiling) of the tunnel to form a ring of electrodes at each along-tunnel location.
